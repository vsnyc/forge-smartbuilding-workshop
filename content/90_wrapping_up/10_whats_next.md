Now that you understand the Quick Start development process, and how you can place into a deployment pipeline using AWS CodePipeline,
you can build complete automation of your Forge and BIM 360 application deployments on AWS using the approach. 

This results a continuous delivery pipeline where every step is automated insuring reliable updates to both the application and the infrastructure. Continuous delivery increases agility and allows your developers to focus their energy and time on development to delight your customers.   
 
I hope this workshop has given you some insight into how automation can ease deployment and operations, freeing up time to focus on development and enabling greater agility.
