## Continuous delivery: How to easily take your Forge application from Development to Production

### Welcome!

<p style='text-align: left;'>
    In this workshop, you will learn how to easily take your Forge application from Development to Production. 
    We will use the Autodesk Forge AWS Quick Start as a base, and build a AWS CodePipeline infrastructure for continuous 
    integration and delivery (CI/CD). We will start with the basics of using GitHub as a source control management (SCM) system,
    deploy the Quick Start to get the base application up and then make modifications to code to update the application. 
    With the CodePipeline setup in place, we'll demonstrate how you can easily test your infrastructure and application and promote 
    your changes to production at the click of a button.
