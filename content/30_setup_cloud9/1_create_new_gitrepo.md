1. Using your web browser navigate to the [aws-quickstart/quickstart-autodesk-forge](https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-autodesk-forge) repository.

2. Click **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the page.
![Create a fork](({{< resource url="images/fork-quickstart-repo.png" >}})

3. If you belong to multiple GitHub organizations, choose the **account** you would like to use for this fork.

You now, have a fork of the original *aws-quickstart/quickstart-autodesk-forge* in your selected GitHub account.
