      <description>If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip this page.
  If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have a GitHub account: create one now
 Once you sign up, you may need to verify your email address.
 It is also a good security practice to setup two-factor authentication.

 Clean up steps  The order below is important to remove resources cleanly.   Go to AWS CloudFormation console in US West (N. Virginia) Region and delete the root (non-nested) stack that starts with the name tCaT-forge-. We had setup the CI/CD pipeline to not auto-delete the test stack to save testing time.</description>

      <description>Clone git repo in Cloud9 IDE using the following command in your terminal, replacing GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub user name: git clone --recursive https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/quickstart-autodesk-forge.git
When asked for a user name and password, use your GITHUB_USERNAME and GITHUB_TOKEN that you created earlier. Now you have the Quick Start code downloaded to your IDE so you can make any changes. ![arch]((https://vsnyc.github.io/forge-smartbuilding-workshop/images/clone-quick-start.png)
 To deploy the Quick Start and the CodePipeline, we need to prepare the following.</description>

      <description>Updating the Quick Start We will now update our app and setup a CodePipeline to deploy our changes automatically. We&amp;rsquo;ll replace the default app with an app that displays a custom logo for the deployed Forge web app. In the Cloud9 IDE:
 In terminal, go to the repo packages directory: cd ~/environment/quickstart-autodesk-forge/packages/
 Download a new sample Forge app with a custom logo added. Look into the change we did to the forge-viewmodels-nodejs-aws-smartbuilding.</description>

      <description> After you have approved the change, the CodePipeline will execute the ChangeSet. Go to the CloudFormation console, you should see Forge-Prod-Stack being updated. ![arch]((https://vsnyc.github.io/forge-smartbuilding-workshop/images/prod-stack-update-progress.png) In about 5 minutes, the stack will reach UPDATE_COMPLETE status. ![arch]((https://vsnyc.github.io/forge-smartbuilding-workshop/images/prod-stack-update-complete.png) Go to the ForgeAppURL again and verify that your application now shows a custom logo for the Forge app (Tested in Chrome browser) ![arch]((https://vsnyc.github.io/forge-smartbuilding-workshop/images/updated-app-with-custom-logo.png?height=60%&amp;amp;width=60%)  </description>

      <description> Our Goal In this workshop, we will learn:
 Setting-up source control for Quick Start artifacts Setting-up a development environment to build your Forge applications using the AWS Quick Start Deploying the default Autodesk Forge Quick Start to use as a starting point of your production deployment [Optional] Setting-up CICD pipeline to continuously build, test, and deploy your Forge application code changes [Optional] Making code updates to the Forge application [Optional] Testing the code updates automatically using AWS CodePipeline [Optional] Releasing the changes to production after a manual approval  </description>

      <guid>https://vsnyc.github.io/forge-smartbuilding-workshop/90_wrapping_up/10_whats_next.html</guid>
      <description>Now that you understand the Quick Start development process, and how you can place into a deployment pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, you can build complete automation of your Forge and BIM 360 application deployments on AWS using the approach.
This results a continuous delivery pipeline where every step is automated insuring reliable updates to both the application and the infrastructure. Continuous delivery increases agility and allows your developers to focus their energy and time on development to delight your customers.</description>

      <description>If you are doing this as part of a workshop using the Event Engine, you can skip this page. We have pre-provisioned a Cloud9 environment for you.
 AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.</description>

      <description>AWS Quick Start Architecture Here&amp;rsquo;s the architecture of what we will build:
![arch]((https://vsnyc.github.io/forge-smartbuilding-workshop/images/autodesk-forge-on-aws-arch.png)
This architecture contains following components:
 A virtual private cloud (VPC) that spans two Availability Zones, configured with two public and two private subnets. In a public subnet, a bastion host to provide Secure Shell (SSH) access to the web servers. The bastion host is maintained by an Auto Scaling group that spans multiple Availability Zones, and is configured to ensure there is always one bastion host available.</description>

      <description>The GitHub repository for the Autodesk Forge Quick Start includes the following files and folders:
 .taskcat.yml - Contains the test configuration and parameters used for automated testing. templates - Contains the AWS CloudFormation templates for the Quick Start. The templates can be in .yaml or .json file formats. packages - Contains the Forge application that gets deployed as part of the Quick Start submodules - Used for any referenced Quick Starts that are configured as submodules of the Quick Start.</description>

      <description>Setting up the CICD pipeline  Let&amp;rsquo;s upload the quickstart-autodesk-forge.zip and the test config file taskcat_project_override.json to demo bucket
cd ~/environment
aws s3 cp quickstart-autodesk-forge.zip s3://$(cat au-demo-bucket.txt)/
aws s3 cp .taskcat_overrides.yml s3://$(cat au-demo-bucket.txt)/
 In a new browser tab, open the following launch stack link that will setup your CodePipeline. Most fields are populated with defaults, fill in only the blank fields.
 Repository owner: your GitHub user name OAuth2 token: your GitHub oauth token created in Step 4 Email: your email address ConfigBucket: your demo bucket created earlier, this value is saved in au-demo-bucket.</description>

![arch]((https://vsnyc.github.io/forge-smartbuilding-workshop/images/forge-cicd-taskcat-pipeline.png)
This architecture contains following components:
 Source stage: The Source stage consists of your Forge Quick Start code located in a GitHub repository and the configuration files you&amp;rsquo;ll need to run your test and production stacks stored securely in Amazon S3.
 Test build stage: In the event of a source change (code is committed to GitHub or a configuration update is pushed to Amazon S3), a trigger will start the AWS CodePipeline build process, pulling the code from these locations and running a build using AWS CodeBuild.</description>
